  data,
  position,
  value,
  label,
  plate_size = 96,
  plate_type = "square",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame that contains at least a column with plate position information and a column with values or
labels.}

\item{position}{a character column in the \code{data} data frame that contains plate positions. These should be in the format:
row = letter, column = number. So for example A1, D12 etc.}

\item{value}{a character or numeric column in the \code{data} data frame that contains values that should be plotted as colours
on the plate layout. Can be the same column as \code{label}.}

\item{label}{a character or numeric column in the \code{data} data frame that contains values that should be plotted as labels
on the plate layout. Can be the same column as \code{value}.}

\item{plate_size}{a numeric value that specifies the plate size (number of wells) used for the plot. Possible values
are: 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 and 1536.}

\item{plate_type}{a character value that specifies the well type. Possible values are "round" and "square". The default is
"square".}

\item{colour}{optional, a character vector that contains colours used for the plot. If the \code{value} argument is discrete
the colours are used as provided. If it is continuous a gradient is created using the colours.}

\item{limits}{optional, a numeric vector of length two providing new limits for a colour gradient. Use NA to refer to
the existing minimum or maximum. If this argument is not supplied the existing minimum and maximum of the
values provided to the \code{value} argument are used for the start and end point of the colour gradient.}

\item{title}{optional, a character value that contains the plot title.}

\item{title_size}{optional, a numeric value that determines the text size of the title. The size is also affected by the
\code{scale} argument.}

\item{show_legend}{a logical value that specifies if the plot legend is shown. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{legend_n_row}{optional, a numeric value that specifies the number of rows of legends. If no value is provided,
the automatic ggplot default is used.}

\item{label_size}{optional, a numeric value that determines the text size of the well labels. The size is also affected by the
\code{scale} argument.}

\item{silent}{a logical value that specifies if the function should report the size of the plotting area and the adjusted
scale parameter. Default is \code{TRUE} meaning it will not return any message. The plot was optimized for a device size of:
width = 5.572917 in and height = 3.177083 in, which was determined using the function \code{par("fin")}. This means if the device
has these dimensions the scaling factor is 1.}

\item{scale}{a numeric value that scales point sizes and labels of the plot. If not provided, the plot uses the device size
to find the optimal scaling factor for the output, however, this might be slightly off (e.g. due to number of labels) and
can be manually adjusted with this argument.}
}
\value{
A plate layout plot.
}
\description{

with colours and labels.
